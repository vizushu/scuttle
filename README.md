## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
Navigate to a folder where you want to put Scuttle, open a terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whimsypingu/scuttle.git
```

Then run this to preview options:
```bash
cd scuttle
python main.py --help
```

### 2. Setup the environment
Run the setup script to prepare the python environment. This will:
* Create a Python virtual environment (```/venv```)
* Install all required dependencies (please see ```/requirements.txt``` in [dependencies](#dependencies))
* Download a ```cloudflared``` executable for tunneling from [the official open source repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/)

```bash
python main.py --setup
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment
Before running the server, activate the virtual environment:
* Windows (cmd):
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
* Windows (Powershell):
```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
* macOS/Linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```


## Usage

### 1. Start the server
Ensure you've [activated the virtual environment](#3-activate-the-virtual-environment) first. 

Run:
```bash
python main.py
```


#### 1.1 (Optional) Set up Discord webhook notifications:
Scuttle can provide the tunneled link to a Discord channel using a webhook URL, so you can access your audio on any device that has access to the channel. To set this up:

1. Follow [this official guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) to get a Discord webhook URL (~2 min)
2. Run the following command to save the webhook URL to your `.env` file:
```bash
python main.py --set-webhook [URL]
```

ðŸ’¡ While the server is running, your device will stay awake to maintain the connection, though the display may turn off to conserve battery.

### 2. Shut down the server
Press ```Ctrl+C``` in the terminal to shut off the server and allow your device to sleep normally again.
